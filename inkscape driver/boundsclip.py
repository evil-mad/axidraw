    """
    Step through subpaths in the digest, clipping them at plot
    boundaries, splitting them into additional subpaths if necessary.

    The plot boundary is defined by (0,0) and a maximum X and Y value
    which may be defined by the physical bounds, or both the physical
    bounds and the document bounds. Return a warning message if the
    requested travel exceeds the bounds by greater than the tolerance.

    Inputs:
    digest: A path_objects.DocDigest object
    phy_bounds: Physical bounds. A 4-element list:
        [[x_min, y_min],[x_max, y_max]], adjusted out for rounding tolerance
    doc_bounds: Document bounds. A 2-element list with (x_max, y_max)
    warn_tol: Distance that motion exceed limits without warning messages
    doc_clip: Boolean. If True, clip at both phy_bounds and doc_bounds

    Output: Warning text or None

    Flatten the document prior to clipping if it is not already flattened.

    This routine performs no rotation; digest orientation should match
    orientation for which the bounds are given.

    Notes on boundaries and warnings about clipping:

    Generate a warning only if the requested motion:
    (1) Exceeds the physical bounds by at least the value of warn_tol, AND
    (2) Is clipped by physical limits, rather than the page size, AND
    (3) Is clipped in the positive direction (not at X = 0 or Y = 0).

    No warning will be generated when travel is limited by a document
    size smaller than the travel, nor at the lower limits of travel.

    Both sets of bounds are typically set slightly past the nominal
    boundaries, by a value typically 1e-9. This ensures that clipping is not
    applied to values that are within float precision of the nominal bounds.
    For example, if a square has a side at Y position at nominal zero but
    numericly  -1.05E-14, we do not want to clip, and thereby omit, that side.
