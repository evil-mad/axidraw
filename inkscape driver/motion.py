    """
    Now, step through every vertex in the trajectory, and calculate what the speed
    should be when arriving at that vertex.

    In order to do so, we need to understand how the trajectory will evolve in terms
    of position and velocity for a certain amount of time in the future, past that vertex.
    The most extreme cases of this is when we are traveling at
    full speed initially, and must come to a complete stop.
        (This is actually more sudden than if we must reverse course-- that must also
        go through zero velocity at the same rate of deceleration, and a full reversal
        that does not occur at the path end might be able to have a
        nonzero velocity at the endpoint.)

    Thus, we look ahead from each vertex until one of the following occurs:
        (1) We have looked ahead by at least t_max, or
        (2) We reach the end of the path.

    The data that we have to start out with is this:
        - The position and velocity at the previous vertex
        - The position at the current vertex
        - The position at subsequent vertices
        - The velocity at the final vertex (zero)

    To determine the correct velocity at each vertex, we will apply the following rules:

    (A) For the first point, V(i = 0) = 0.

    (B) For the last point point, V = 0 as well.

    (C) If the length of the segment is greater than the distance
    required to reach full speed, then the vertex velocity may be as
    high as the maximum speed.

    Note that we must actually check not the total *speed* but the acceleration
    along the two native motor axes.

    (D) If not; if the length of the segment is less than the total distance
    required to get to full speed, then the velocity at that vertex
    is limited by to the value that can be reached from the initial
    starting velocity, in the distance given.

    (E) The maximum velocity through the junction is also limited by the
    turn itself-- if continuing straight, then we do not need to slow down
    as much as if we were fully reversing course.
    We will model each corner as a short curve that we can accelerate around.

    (F) To calculate the velocity through each turn, we must _look ahead_ to
    the subsequent (i+1) vertex, and determine what velocity
    is appropriate when we arrive at the next point.

    Because future points may be close together-- the subsequent vertex could
    occur just before the path end -- we actually must look ahead past the
    subsequent (i + 1) vertex, all the way up to the limits that we have described
    (e.g., t_max) to understand the subsequent behavior. Once we have that effective
    endpoint, we can work backwards, ensuring that we will be able to get to the
    final speed/position that we require.

    A less complete (but far simpler) procedure is to first complete the trajectory
    description, and then -- only once the trajectory is complete -- go back through,
    but backwards, and ensure that we can actually decelerate to each velocity.

    (G) The minimum velocity through a junction may be set to a constant.
    There is often some (very slow) speed -- perhaps a few percent of the maximum speed
    at which there are little or no resonances. Even when the path must directly reverse
    itself, we can usually travel at a non-zero speed. This, of course, presumes that we
    still have a solution for getting to the endpoint at zero speed.

    Next, we wish to estimate total time duration of this segment.
    In doing so, we must consider the possible cases:

    Case 1: 'Trapezoid'
        Segment length is long enough to reach full speed.
        Segment length > accel_dist_max + decel_dist_max
        As a second check, make sure that the segment is long enough that it would take at
        least 4 time slices at maximum velocity.

    Case 2: 'Triangle'
        Segment length is not long enough to reach full speed.
        Accelerate from initial velocity to a local maximum speed,
        then decelerate from that point to the final velocity.

    Case 3: 'Linear velocity ramp'
        For small enough moves -- say less than 10 intervals (typ 500 ms),
        we do not have significant time to ramp the speed up and down.
        Instead, perform only a simple speed ramp between initial and final.

    Case 4: 'Constant velocity'
        Use a single, constant velocity for all pen-down movements.
        Also a fallback position, when moves are too short for linear ramps.

    In each case, we ultimately construct the trajectory in segments at constant velocity.
    In cases 1-3, that set of segments approximates a linear slope in velocity.

    Because we may end up with slight over/undershoot in position along the paths
    with this approach, we perform a final scaling operation (to the correct distance) at the end.

            Case 2: 'Triangle'

            We will _not_ reach full cruising speed, but let's go as fast as we can!

            We begin with given: initial velocity, final velocity,
                maximum acceleration rate, distance to travel.

            The optimal solution is to accelerate at the maximum rate, to some maximum velocity
            Vmax, and then to decelerate at same maximum rate, to the final velocity.
            This forms a triangle on the plot of V(t).

            The value of Vmax -- and the time at which we reach it -- may be varied in order to
            accommodate our choice of distance-traveled and velocity requirements.
            (This does assume that the segment requested is self consistent, and planned
            with respect to our acceleration requirements.)

            In a more detail, with short notation Vi = vi_inch_per_s,
                Vf = vf_inch_per_s, and Amax = accel_rate_local, Dv = (Vf - Vi)

            (i) We accelerate from Vi, at Amax to some maximum velocity Vmax.
            This takes place during an interval of time Ta.

            (ii) We then decelerate from Vmax, to Vf, at the same maximum rate, Amax.
            This takes place during an interval of time Td.

            (iii) The total time elapsed is Ta + Td

            (iv) v = v0 + a * t
                =>    Vmax = Vi + Amax * Ta
                and   Vmax = Vf + Amax * Td  (i.e., Vmax - Amax * Td = Vf)

                Thus Td = Ta - (Vf - Vi) / Amax, or Td = Ta - (Dv / Amax)

            (v) The distance covered during the acceleration interval Ta is given by:
                Xa = Vi * Ta + (1/2) Amax * Ta^2

                The distance covered during the deceleration interval Td is given by:
                Xd = Vf * Td + (1/2) Amax * Td^2

                Thus, the total distance covered during interval Ta + Td is given by:
                segment_length_inches =
                    Xa + Xd = Vi * Ta + (1/2) Amax * Ta^2 + Vf * Td + (1/2) Amax * Td^2

            (vi) Now substituting in Td = Ta - (Dv / Amax), we find:
                Amax * Ta^2 + 2 * Vi * Ta + (Vi^2 - Vf^2)/( 2 * Amax ) - segment_length_inches = 0

                Solving this quadratic equation for Ta, we find:
                Ta = ( sqrt(2 * Vi^2 + 2 * Vf^2 + 4 * Amax * segment_length_inches)
                    - 2 * Vi ) / ( 2 * Amax )

                [We pick the positive root in the quadratic formula, since Ta must be positive.]

            (vii) From Ta and part (iv) above, we can find Vmax and Td.

                Linear velocity interpolation between two endpoints.

                Because these are short segments (not enough time for a good "triangle"), we
                boost the starting speed, by taking its average with vmax for the segment.

                For very short segments (less than 2 time slices), use a single
                    segment with constant velocity.
