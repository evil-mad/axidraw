interactive_penheights.py

Demonstrate use of axidraw module in "interactive" mode.
Set pen to different heights.

Run this demo by calling: python interactive_penheights.py



---------------------------------------------------------------------

About the interactive API:

Interactive mode is a mode of use, designed for plotting individual motion
segments upon request, using direct XY control. It is a complement to the
usual plotting modes, which take an SVG document as input.

So long as the AxiDraw is started in the home corner, moves are limit checked,
and constrained to be within the safe travel range of the AxiDraw.
