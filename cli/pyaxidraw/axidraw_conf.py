'''
Primary user-adjustable control parameters:

We encourage you to freely tune these values as needed to match the
 behavior and performance of your AxiDraw to your application and taste.

These parameters are used as defaults when using AxiDraw with the command-
 line interface (CLI) or with the python library. With the CLI, you can
 make copies of this configuration file and specify a configuration file.

If you are operating the AxiDraw from within Inkscape, please set your
 preferences within Inkscape, using the AxiDraw Control dialog.
 Most values listed here are ignored when running within Inkscape.
 
Similarly, values set within Inkscape are ignored when using the CLI or
 python library.

Additional user-adjustable control parameters:

These parameters are adjustable only from the command line, and are not
visible from within the Inkscape GUI.

'''

check_updates = True  # If True, allow AxiDraw Control to check online to see
                      #    what the current software version is, when you
                      #    query the version. Set to False to disable. Note that
                      #    this is the only internet-enabled function in the
                      #    AxiDraw software.

smoothness = 10.0     # Curve smoothing (default: 10.0)

cornering = 10.0      # Cornering speed factor (default: 10.0)


# Effective motor resolution is approx. 1437 or 2874 steps per inch, in the two modes respectively.
# Note that these resolutions are defined along the native axes of the machine (X+Y) and (X-Y),
# not along the XY axes of the machine. This parameter chooses 8X or 16X microstepping on the motors.

Secondary control parameters:

Values below this point are configured only in this file, not through the user interface(s).
Please note that these values have been carefully chosen, and generally do not need to be 
adjusted in everyday use. That said, proceed with caution, and keep a backup copy.

native_res_factor = 1016.0  # Motor resolution calculation factor, steps per inch, and used in conversions. Default: 1016.0
# Note that resolution is defined along native (not X or Y) axes.
# Resolution is native_res_factor * sqrt(2) steps per inch in Low Resolution  (Approx 1437 steps per inch)

# The new limiting values are equivalent to 16%, 86% on that prior scale, giving a little less vertical range, but higher resolution.
