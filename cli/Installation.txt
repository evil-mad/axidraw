AxiDraw CLI and Python API — Installation

Supported on python 3.8 and newer
Mac, Windows, and Linux.


—————————————————————————————————————————
INSTALLATION

1.) Install python (minimum version 3.8)

Macs and linux boxes usually have python pre-installed.

If you are on Windows, you'll probably not already have this on your computer. 
Go to: https://www.python.org/download/


2.) [Recommended, optional] Use `venv` to control versioning

Create a virtual python environment:

    python3 -m venv venv

Replace `python3` with the name of the python on your system you want to use, e.g.  `python`, `py`,
`python3.11`, etc.

This creates a directory called `venv` which contains the files for the new environment.

Activate the environment:

    source venv/bin/activate # bash/zsh shells, like on mac, ubuntu
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # windows powershell

Now your command prompt should be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating that you are now in the virtual
environment you created.  You can now continue as normal.  More reading about python virtual
environments: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html


3.) Install this software (`pyaxidraw` and `axicli`)

Unzip the archive and move into the folder:

    cd /Users/username/Documents/axidraw-api/  (Your location and path will vary)

Then use pip to install it:

    pip install .

Some additional flags on the `pip` command (like `--user`) are not supported in most situations. If
you need to customize the installation (e.g., with extra `pip` flags like `--user`), you can modify
the following commands and use them instead:

    pip install prebuild_dependencies/* # add flags here, e.g. `--user`
    pip install . # add flags here, e.g. `--user`

4.) Test that the software is operational:

A (very simple) sample file is included. You can plot it with the following command line:

    axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg

If everything is set up correctly, this should plot the SVG file, which contains a very simple
drawing.

GETTING STARTED

* Getting started with the command-line interface:
You can get additional documentation and command-line usage options by using

    axicli --help

or refer to the full documentation, at: https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/

An example file is included. To plot it, use:

    axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg

* Getting started with the python API:
Two example python scripts are included. See README.txt for instructions.

For the full python API documentation, please see: https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/. The same API
documentation is also included in the `documentation` folder of this download.

________________________________________
TROUBLESHOOTING

(A) If you get errors (especially on Windows) indicating that `axicli` or `pip` is not a recognized
command, you may need to add `python -m` to the beginning of the commands, e.g.:

    python -m axicli <input> '
    python -m pip install <etc>

You may need to replace `python` with the name of the python on your system you want to use, e.g.
`python3`, `python3.11`, etc.

You can add the python scripts directory to your system path in order to use `axicli` or `pip`
directly.

(B) If you get the error “The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required [...]”, then you do not
have lxml installed. Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html.

You can also contact technical support.

(C) If you get the error "ImportError: No module named pyserial", then you do not have pyserial installed.

(D) If you get the error "Failed to connect to AxiDraw":
    1. On linux, this message may indicate permissions problems. Refer to https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation#About_adding_your_user_account_to_the_.22dialout.22_group
    2. Your computer may not be able to locate the AxiDraw via USB. Check that it's plugged in.

If you do not have an AxiDraw in front of you, you can still use various offline functions. The
following will render a preview of how the file will plot, and report the time that it will take to
plot, even with no AxiDraw machine present:

    axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg -Tvg3 -o outputfile.svg



_________________________________________
UNINSTALLING

If you used a python virtual environment (step 2), uninstalling is as simple as leaving the virtual
environment.  The easiest way to do that is to close your terminal.

If you did not use a virtual environment, use pip to uninstall:

    pip uninstall pyaxidraw axicli

You may also want to uninstall `pyaxidraw`'s dependencies, assuming you aren't using them for anything
else:

    pip uninstall -r requirements/requirements.txt

SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS

Recommended procedures for installing this software:

(A) Mac Users:

From the terminal, enter the following, providing password when requested:

    xcode-select --install


(B) Windows Users:

You may need to open your command prompt with a right-click and "Run as administrator" in order to
avoid permissions errors.
